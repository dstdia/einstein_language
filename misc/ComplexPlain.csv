"Jessica Rojas beat poverty to put herself through engineering college, where she collected accolades for academic achievement.","Complex"
"After graduating last year, Ms. Rojas, who grew up in Chicago, was hired by a utility company to help modernize the city\’s electrical grid.","Complex"
"But her life could soon be upended in a showdown over a five-year-old initiative, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which has granted permission to stay and work to about 800,000 immigrants like Ms. Rojas who were brought illegally to the United States as children.","Complex"
"Since attacking DACA on the campaign trail, President Trump has pledged to keep the program alive, calling recipients, also known as Dreamers, absolutely incredible kids who deserve compassion. ","Complex"
"But in recent days, key players in his administration have advised Mr. Trump to wind down the program, and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has informed him he considers it unconstitutional and cannot defend it in court, according to people familiar with the discussions who insisted on anonymity to describe private deliberations.","Complex"
"While the White House has declined to comment on the fate of DACA, several officials and people briefed on the discussions now say the president is on the brink of ending it, although they note that Mr. Trump often changes his mind.","Complex"
"Mr. Trump has been pondering — and publicly agonizing over — what to do about the program since he took office. But discussions about it inside the White House took on new urgency after a group of conservative state attorneys general threatened to sue the Trump administration in federal court unless it begins to dismantle the program by Sept. 5.","Complex"
"John F. Kelly, the president\’s chief of staff, expressed skepticism in July, when he was homeland security secretary, that the program would survive legal scrutiny.","Complex"
"The Justice Department would be responsible for defending DACA, but Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a fierce opponent of the program, has not said whether he would, and the president has not said whether he would order Mr. Sessions to do so.","Complex"
"Even if he did, it is not clear that the program would survive a court challenge; ","Complex"
"Republican attorneys general have had success blocking other Obama-era immigration policies.","Complex"
"But a decision by the administration not to defend it would almost certainly spell a death knell for the program, said Paul Virtue, a partner in the law firm of Mayer Brown who in the 1980s and \’90s was a senior official at the Immigration and Naturalization Service, as the agency was then known.","Complex"
"DACA has changed the lives of many beneficiaries, enabling them to qualify for financial aid for college, secure better jobs and open bank accounts.","Complex"
"These milestones on the road to self-sufficiency would be jeopardized if DACA is wiped out.","Complex"
"It allowed me to blend into society in every way, said Monica Lazaro, 24, who was born in Honduras but raised in Miami.","Complex"
"DACA made it possible for her to obtain a driver\’s license, pay in-state college tuition and live without fear.","Complex"
"Ms. Lazaro has been working as a research associate at Nova Southeastern University studying chronic fatigue syndrome, and recently received security clearance to work at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Miami.","Complex"
"Without DACA, I would be fired immediately,c she said.","Complex"
"Most crucially, if DACA ends, those who benefit from the program would again be eligible for deportation.","Complex"
"And they would not be hard to find — the Department of Homeland Security has DACA and tax documents showing their addresses, which may also be the addresses of their undocumented parents.","Complex"
"CUNY administrators acknowledged that there has been some resistance, particularly from some members of the math faculty who believe algebra to be foundational, something all educated adults should master. Dr. Rabinowitz said the reticence has not come from its highest performing community colleges.","Complex"
"The way students qualify to be promoted out of remediation is changing, as well. Until recently, CUNY required students to pass remediation courses and then pass a test, a fairly unusual requirement. Now, administrators say, students will just have to pass the course. The final test, which they will still take, will count for up to 35 percent of a course grade.","Complex"
"Twenty-thousand new students arrived at public community colleges in New York City last fall only to be told they were not ready for college-level work.","Complex"
"Instead, they were placed in remedial classes to complete the preparation they were supposed to have received in high school.","Complex"
"But for a significant portion of these students, remedial courses will not put them any closer to a degree.","Complex"
"The courses take time and cost money — or consume a portion of a student\’s financial aid — while offering no credits.","Complex"
"Many students, frustrated that they are sitting in class without progressing toward a degree, drop out.","Complex"
"It is a pattern replicated every year, not just in New York but at community colleges across the country.","Complex"
"Now, the City University of New York, the largest urban public university system in the United States, is moving to fundamentally rework its traditional remedial programs.","Complex"
"Administrators hope program changes this year and in 2018 will make necessary catch-up less of a stumbling block, while ensuring that students who are in college-level classes are prepared to do the work.","Complex"
"The notion is that if you can succeed in college, we want to help you get there","Complex"
"said Vita C. Rabinowitz, executive vice chancellor and university provost at CUNY.","Complex"
"No artificial barriers or screening devices. ","Complex"
"It\’s a matter of true college readiness.","Complex"
"Dr. Rabinowitz said that about 80 percent of freshman entering community college in the CUNY system require remediation in reading, writing, math, or some combination of those subjects.","Complex"
"Students of color are twice as likely to be assessed as needing remediation as white students.","Complex"
"But at the end of one year, only half of all students in remediation have advanced out of those classes.","Complex"
"The need for remediation is a chronic problem at community colleges around the country as students graduate from high school without the skills they need for college.","Complex"
"We had outcomes that were in line with national averages, which is to say very disappointing","Complex"
"And if that\’s not working, then CUNY is not working.","Complex"
"One fundamental shift CUNY is planning will address how students are assigned to remedial courses.","Complex"
"Traditionally, most students entering CUNY community colleges take placement tests in reading, writing and math, which determines who needs help.","Complex"
"But researchers and college administrators around the country worry that these tests put people in remedial classes who could have done well without them.","Complex"
"In fact, ACT, the testing company, withdrew its placement test from the market last year over such concerns.","Complex"
"Ed Colby, a spokesman for the company said that the test, called Compass, and others like it, were not placing students where they should be.","Complex"
"Students who had been out of high school for a few years when they took the exam were particularly likely to be unnecessarily steered toward remediation, Mr. Colby said.","Complex"
"For now, CUNY has switched to a different test — ACCUPLACER, which is a College Board exam — but the plan is to incorporate other measures as well.","Complex"
"David Crook, associate university provost for academic affairs at CUNY, said they were considering looking at students\’ grades in relevant classes, or perhaps their overall grade point average.","Complex"
"They hope to have a new system in place for the fall of 2018.","Complex"
"CUNY has also put in place an automatic retesting policy for those who score just below the passing cutoff on the math and reading placement tests.","Complex"
"Since the option was put in place last fall, about 550 students have taken advantage of it on the reading exam, and of those, 49 percent passed on their second try.","Complex"
"Three hundred students retook the math test, and of those students, 55 percent passed.","Complex"
"For those who still need remedial classes, there will be new requirements.","Complex"
"In the past, those students all had to pass algebra, regardless of whether they planned to study English or economics.","Complex"
"CUNY will now require all of its associate degree programs to offer an alternative to remedial algebra, like quantitative reasoning or statistics.","Complex"
"It doesn\’t make sense to prevent students from taking college-level courses because they don\’t have skills that they won\’t use","Complex"
"said Thomas Bailey, a professor of economics and education at Columbia University\’s Teachers College and the director of the Community College Research Center.","Complex"
"These are legitimate college-level math courses, he said of alternatives like statistics.","Complex"
"Community college structures were built around the need for remediation, a very large need for remediation, Dr. Rabinowitz said, citing such institutional basics as course schedules, departmental structures and faculty hiring.","Complex"
"Disrupting this is truly disrupting how big organizations operate, and that\’s stressful.","Complex"
"CUNY\’s new math courses will be different in another way.","Complex"
"Schools will be required to offer them as corequisites, which means students will take two courses at the same time: a normal credit bearing class, along with a class designed to help them do well in the credited class.","Complex"
"Tennessee\’s community college and university system has seen encouraging results by offering corequisites, which allow students to earn credits while taking remedial courses.","Complex"
"A similar program will be offered in most community colleges in the CUNY system by the spring of 2018.","Complex"
"About 60 percent of Tennessee system students arrive needing remediation.","Complex"
"But in the past, only 12 percent of remedial students completed a credit-bearing math course within the first year.","Complex"
"After the corequisite program was put in place in 2015, that number jumped to 51 percent.","Complex"
"In writing, the pass rates nearly doubled from 31 percent to 59 percent.","Complex"
"Tristan Denley, vice chancellor for academic affairs at the Tennessee Board of Regents, said that with traditional remediation, many students felt they were just treading water, while with corequisites, they feel they are getting closer to graduation.","Complex"
"The idea that \‘first you do this, then you do that\’ is not as pedagogically effective as it seems, Dr. Denley said of traditional remediation.","Complex"
"It\’s much better to say, \‘let\’s learn this, and we will support you along the way.\’","Complex"
"Dr. Rabinowitz emphasized, however, that credit-bearing courses and graduation requirements at CUNY will not change.","Complex"
"So if the new remediation programs push students through who are not ready, they will fail, administrators said, and CUNY would have to account for that.","Complex"
"There are 800,000 Dreamers.","Plain"
"Most of the Dreamers are the children of Mexican adults who crossed the border without papers.","Plain"
"Or who overstayed their tourist or school visas.","Plain"
"President Obama signed an executive order.","Plain"
"The order said these young people could apply for legal status.","Plain"
"They could stay in the U.S. They could go to school or work.","Plain"
"Obama signed the order because Congress did not act on the subject of immigration.","Plain"
"Most Republicans did not like the idea of the order.","Plain"
"When Donald Trump ran as a candidate for president, he said he would revoke the order.","Plain"
"He now is President Trump.","Plain"
"President Trump had a good impulse.","Plain"
"He said most of the Dreamers were incredible kids.","Plain"
"He decided he wanted to find a way to allow them to stay.","Plain"
"Now he has a political problem. Some state attorneys general want the Dreamer program to end.","Plain"
"They say they will try to overturn the executive order in the U.S. federal courts.","Plain"
"The states believe they can win.","Plain"
"The question for Trump is:","Plain"
"will the Department of Justice defend the program?","Plain"
"If the Department does, Trump will be opposing states that he won in the election.","Plain"
"It is a political problem for him.","Plain"
"What about the Dreamers?","Plain"
"What once seemed a certain future comes to an end.","Plain"
"The government can deport them.","Plain"
"It knows all about them from their applications.","Plain"
"They must refile applications every two years.","Plain"
"Was Obama\’s order constitutional?","Plain"
"No one knows for sure if the states would win in court.","Plain"
"The courts have rejected other similar orders issued by Obama.","Plain"
"Immigration to America has a history as long as the country\’s history.","Plain"
"In the beginning, the Spanish, French, English, Dutch and Germans settled the new land.","Plain"
"In the last half of the nineteenth century, Italians, Irish, Chinese and Jewish immigrants arrived.","Plain"
"Immigrants provided the cheap labor for the growth of America.","Plain"
"The going was never easy. ","Plain"
"Different laws on immigration made it easier or harder to get into the country.","Plain"
"Groups that did not welcome them usually opposed the new arrivals.","Plain"
"Do immigrants take the jobs of settled workers?","Plain"
"Cheap labor made this country. ","Plain"
"So, yes there is some truth to that charge.","Plain"
"But countries need to grow. ","Plain"
"Immigrants provide the growth in numbers and workers. ","Plain"
"Growing populations produce prosperity.","Plain"
"Trump had the right idea about Dreamers.","Plain"
"It is one thing to get into a community college.","Plain"
"It is another to get credits for courses","Plain"
"Many students are ill-prepared.","Plain"
"They may not be ready for college-level work.","Plain"
"They must take remedial courses.","Plain"
"Most remedial courses are for reading or math.","Plain"
"The problem is that remedial courses cost money and take time.","Plain"
"Students often feel like they are \treading water.","Plain"
"Some feel the remedial courses are not \real college classes.","Plain"
"The dropout rates are high.","Plain"
"University of New York (CUNY) wanted to do something to reduce the dropout rate.","Plain"
"The school looked at the results of the entry test.","Plain"
"Some of the students had been out of school for several years.","Plain"
"It focused on those students who almost passed.","Plain"
"CUNY is letting those students who almost passed retake the test.","Plain"
"About half pass on the second try.","Plain"
"Was the test doing a good job of finding students who needed more help?","Plain"
"CUNY decided that the answer was no.","Plain"
"It put a new test in place.","Plain"
"The steps for moving from remedial to credit classes is also changing.","Plain"
"Before, students had to pass a test at the end of the remedial course.","Plain"
"Now, they just must pass the course.","Plain"
"They still take the test, but it is a factor for only 35 percent of the final grade.","Plain"
"It may also start looking at how students did in certain high school classes.","Plain"
"Algebra was a required part of the math entry exam.","Plain"
"Now students can take an alternative course such as statistics.","Plain"
"CUNY has taken one more step to make life better for students.","Plain"
"While students are taking a remedial math course, they can take another course.","Plain"
"This course will be a credit course.","Plain"
"They call it a co-requisite course.","Plain"
"The remedial course will help them pass the regular course.","Plain"
"Community colleges in Tennessee have had good results with this approach.","Plain"
"Everyone knows tests are important.","Plain"
"But experts say tests should not be the only thing that matters.","Plain"
"It makes good sense to move student ahead.","Plain"
