# "Hey Einstein! Thank you for making my CRM even greater"
# Getting started with the Einstein Language APIS

Every word a customer leaves on a Salesforce record can be a source of insights. It can tell about the mood of your customers, and the topics they are talking about. Salesforce has just launched their latest addition to their Einstein universe, and Einstein Language promises to become your language processing companion to build next-generation apps.
 
I am going to discuss use cases for Einstein Language Intent and Sentiment and demonstrate how to integrate Einstein language into your application. We’ll build our first Einstein Language powered app to give you ideas how to get started with this new Salesforce Einstein service.

## Highly recommended
Build the cat rescue app to learn how the Einstein Platform works.

## Prerequisites
* No use to build my sample code - there's something better:
* Clone and deploy René Winkelmeyer's Apex Wrappers for the Einstein Platform APIs: https://github.com/muenzpraeger/salesforce-einstein-platform-apex
* Sign up for a Einstein.ai account
* Put the email address you used for signing up to Einstein.ai into the "Einstein Settings" custom setting
* Store your Einstein certificate into your org's FIles. It *must* be named "Einstein_Platform"
